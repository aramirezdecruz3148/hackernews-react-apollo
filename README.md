# About This Project

I created this project to begin playing with GraphQL, React and Apollo. This tutorial is a full-stack Hackernews clone. The full tutorial can be found here: https://www.howtographql.com/react-apollo/0-introduction/ 

In this tutorial, I learned how to build a front-end to an already existing back-end tutorial I completed: https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-js/0-introduction/, using Node, GraphQL, graphql-yoga, amd Prisma. I went ahead and just copied the code from this tutorial directly into this build and augmented it slightly.
